# almighty-test
This repo is for testing UX Designs using HTML and CSS in a static environment.

### Resources:
 - PatternFly 3
 - Bootstrap 3
 - Node
 - Bower
 - Gulp

## Prerequisites:
  <blockquote>
    This repo assumes that you have Node and Bower installed and know how to use each of those.
  </blockquote>
 - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
 - [Bower.io](https://bower.io)

If you are using MacOS, I recommend using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) for your package manager. You can download Nodejs v6(LTS) directly from there.

 - Fork and Clone the repo
* Step 2:

  </blockquote>
* Step 3:

  <blockquote>

  </blockquote>
* Step 4:
 - run 'gulp'
  <blockquote>
    this will run through all of the initial setup script setups<br />
    <strong>If there are errors with these scripts, please verify that you have NodeJS installed correctly</strong>
  </blockquote>
